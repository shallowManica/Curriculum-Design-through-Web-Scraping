# Curriculum-Design-through-Web-Scraping
This repository designs a course curriculum for a Master’s program in DS &amp; AI. The project involves web-scraping job postings from Indeed.com, extracting and engineering skill-based features using NLP and OpenAI’s text embeddings, and applying both hierarchical and k-means clustering algorithms.
